# Current Work Focus and Recent Changes

- **Initial Project Understanding**: The primary focus has been to understand the overall purpose, technology stack, and key features of the Konsulin frontend project. This involved reviewing `package.json` for dependencies and `README.md` for project setup and deployment information.
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: The project's memory bank has been initialized and updated with comprehensive documentation across `brief.md`, `product.md`, `context.md`, `architecture.md`, and `tech.md`.

# Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Documentation Structure**: Separate markdown files were created for `product.md`, `context.md`, `architecture.md`, and `tech.md` to organize information logically.
- **Content Granularity**: Each document contains relevant and sufficiently detailed information as per the project requirements and user feedback.

# Next Steps for Development

- Proceed with implementation tasks in a suitable mode (e.g., `code` mode).
