# Product Overview: Konsulin Frontend

## Why the Project Exists

The Konsulin frontend project exists to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly interface for the Konsulin platform. It serves as the primary point of interaction for users to access various healthcare and wellness services, manage their personal information, and engage with practitioners and clinics. The project aims to digitize and streamline processes related to health management, appointments, and information access.

## Problems Being Solved

This project addresses several key problems:

- **Fragmented Healthcare Information**: By integrating with FHIR, it aims to centralize and standardize health data, making it more accessible and manageable for users.
- **Inefficient Appointment Scheduling**: Provides a streamlined system for booking and managing appointments with practitioners and clinics.
- **Lack of Centralized Health Records**: Offers a platform for users to maintain and access their health journals and records.
- **Limited Access to Wellness Resources**: Facilitates access to assessments, questionnaires, and exercise-related content.
- **Communication Gaps**: Enables messaging and notification features to improve communication between users and healthcare providers.
- **Outdated User Experiences**: Replaces traditional, often cumbersome, methods of healthcare interaction with a modern, intuitive web application.
